              I&apos;ve loved making (and breaking) things since I was a kid. It
              started with legos, and creating my own mechs by combining
              Bionicle lego sets together into ever more complex iterations and
              of course having them fight each other. I took apart broken
              electronics, played around with BASIC, and told my parents I
              wanted to be an inventor. I liked reading about codes and ciphers,
              and I wrote a report in high school based largely on Simon Singh&apos;s
              "The Code Book" where I learned about the math behind public-key
              cryptography. The idea that one-way functions operated like
              "locks" blew my mind. ðŸ¤¯
            </p>
            <p>
              I was interested in everything but lacked a clear vision. I loved
              the intellectual challenge of the legal profession and tried law
              school. It wasn&apos;t until IBM&apos;s Watson years later that my creative
              mind really saw the possibility of programming and the potential
              of AI. I bought a GTX 1070 graphics card, watched a few tutorials,
              and even got an MNIST digit recognizer model working. I thought
              this code thing was pretty cool! I quickly realized that I lacked
              the basics and foundation to really understand what I was doing,
              and the whole self-taught route just wasn&apos;t working for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having a goal is great, and mine was learning how to code.
              Properly this time. My buddy told me about a coding bootcamp
              called Code Fellows, and I learned web development in JavaScript
              and Python in 2020. I built a stock prediction model using Keras
              and Tensorflow for my final project. I love code because I can
              build tools and apps to be more productive in less time; "tools
              that can build other tools".
            </p>
            <p>
              Since learning to code, I&apos;ve built tech companies, taught coding
              classes, and developed a wide range of applications, APIs, and web
              scrapersâ€”covering the full spectrum of software development.
              Currently, I&apos;m the co-founder and sole developer of Observe
              Safety, an app and company I&apos;m creating with my dad to help
              construction companies efficiently record and manage their safety
              data. We&apos;ve recently begun the alpha testing phase.
